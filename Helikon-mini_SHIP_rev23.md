# Helikon-mini SHIP Manifest — rev23 (v3.0.9 draft candidate)

Date: 2026-04-06

This manifest is the SSOT for the Helikon-mini 3.0.9 draft candidate bundle.

## Product separation invariants (non-negotiable)
- Helikon-mini is a separate product line.
- Helikon-mini artifacts MUST NOT reference or depend on other Helikon lines’ filenames, installer commands, or runtime assumptions.
- Runtime semantics MUST be fully defined by Helikon-mini installers / install package (no doc-only semantics):
  - Unified JSON install package
  - System Layer installer projection
  - Operating Layer installer projection

## Versioning rules (shipping discipline)
- Helikon-mini major versions are independent of Helikon (core) major versions.
- **Kit (bundle) version** is the `vX.Y.Z` in this SHIP header; **revN** increments on any shipped-file change (add/remove/content).
- Shipped components may carry their own versions in filenames; **do not assume** all component filenames match the kit version.
- **Bump rules (minimal churn):**
  - JSON install package filename bumps when package content changes.
  - Installer filenames bump only when installer content changes.
  - README/QA filenames bump when their content changes.
  - Payload/sentinel versions inside installers are integrity markers, not release labels.
- SHIP is the SSOT for exact filenames in the shipped set.

## Draft-candidate authority posture
- `Helikon-mini_Install_Package_v3.0.9.json` is the **primary install artifact** and **installation SSOT** for this candidate set.
- `Helikon-mini_SYSTEM_LAYER_v3.0.4_install.md` and `Helikon-mini_OPERATING_LAYER_v3.0.9_install.md` are synchronized human-readable projections / fallbacks.
- Runtime remains exactly **two layers**:
  - System Layer = Personalization
  - Operating Layer = Saved Memories
- Projects are an optional booster mode only and are not a required runtime layer.

## Non-shipped
- `Helikon-mini_3.0_Architecture_Spec_v0.1.0.md` is a planning artifact and is not part of this shipped candidate set.
- Legacy mini 2.3.7 files are superseded by this 3.0.8 candidate set.
- Planning artifacts must not be treated as runtime semantics.

## Revision notes
- rev23 (v3.0.9 draft candidate): SETUP-to-INSTALL handoff hard-binding + synchronized-surface closure. Bumps the unified JSON install package to v3.0.9 so the System Layer install authority hard-binds the actual `SETUP` response to tell the operator, after both Personalization saves are confirmed, to return to the chat and send `INSTALL` to begin the 6-memory Operating Layer install loop while preserving the beginner-facing menu walkthrough, required Memory-settings step, two-box mapping, and save/reopen flow. Bumps the System Layer installer projection to v3.0.4 to mirror the same hard-bound `SETUP` command surface, bumps the Operating Layer installer projection to v3.0.9 to keep the package-pointer text synchronized with the new JSON package line, bumps QA to v3.0.9 to fail if the actual emitted `SETUP` response omits the required post-save handoff to `INSTALL`, and bumps README / changelog / SHIP pointers to the synchronized v3.0.9 candidate set while leaving runtime semantics, live commands, two-layer runtime shape, and the 6-memory Operating Layer unchanged.

- rev22 (v3.0.8 draft candidate): memory-settings hard-binding + synchronized-surface closure. Bumps the unified JSON install package to v3.0.8 so the System Layer install authority hard-binds the actual `SETUP` response to tell the operator, before pasting the snippets, to open Personalization, turn **Reference saved memories** ON, treat **Reference chat history** as optional best-effort only if present, and use a normal non-Temporary chat for installation while preserving the beginner-facing menu walkthrough, two-box mapping, and save/reopen steps. Bumps the System Layer installer projection to v3.0.3 to mirror the same hard-bound `SETUP` command surface, bumps the Operating Layer installer projection to v3.0.8 to keep the package-pointer text synchronized with the new JSON package line, bumps QA to v3.0.8 to fail if the actual emitted `SETUP` response omits the required Memory-settings step, and bumps README / changelog / SHIP pointers to the synchronized v3.0.8 candidate set, while also restoring exact markdown↔JSON payload-boundary parity for the six Operating payload mirrors and leaving runtime semantics, live commands, two-layer runtime shape, and the 6-memory Operating Layer unchanged.

- rev21 (v3.0.7 draft candidate): SETUP output hard-binding + synchronized-surface closure. Bumps the unified JSON install package to v3.0.7 so the System Layer install authority hard-binds the actual `SETUP` response to begin with a beginner-facing Personalization walkthrough before the snippets: plain-language explanation of Personalization as ChatGPT’s settings/customization area, profile/avatar/name-menu routing, explicit two-box mapping, explicit “do not paste both snippets into the same field” warning, and ordered save/reopen steps. Bumps the System Layer installer projection to v3.0.2 to mirror the same hard-bound `SETUP` command surface, bumps the Operating Layer installer projection to v3.0.7 to keep the package-pointer text synchronized with the new JSON package line, bumps QA to v3.0.7 to fail if the actual emitted `SETUP` response omits that beginner-facing walkthrough before the snippet text, and bumps README / changelog / SHIP pointers to the synchronized v3.0.7 candidate set while leaving runtime semantics, live commands, two-layer runtime shape, and the 6-memory Operating Layer unchanged.

- rev20 (v3.0.6 draft candidate): SETUP clarity + synchronized-surface closure. Bumps the unified JSON install package to v3.0.6 so the System Layer install authority explicitly routes first-time users to **Personalization** and the two correct paste targets (**Custom instructions** and **About you → More about you**), bumps the System Layer installer projection to v3.0.1 to teach the same two-box SETUP path, bumps the Operating Layer installer projection to v3.0.6 to keep the package-pointer text synchronized with the new JSON package line, bumps QA to v3.0.6 to add an explicit SETUP-clarity lock, and bumps README / changelog / SHIP pointers to the synchronized v3.0.6 candidate set while leaving runtime semantics, live commands, two-layer runtime shape, and the 6-memory Operating Layer unchanged.
- rev19 (v3.0.5 draft candidate): command-order truth + regression-lock hardening closure. Bumps the unified JSON install package to v3.0.5 so the Operating Layer live-command metadata array matches the taught operator flow, bumps the Operating Layer installer projection to v3.0.5 to keep the embedded installation script and package-pointer text synchronized with the new JSON package line, bumps QA to v3.0.5 to add `HKS` / `HKO` to the command-family regression lock, and bumps README / changelog / SHIP pointers to the synchronized v3.0.5 candidate set while leaving runtime semantics, live commands, two-layer runtime shape, and 6-memory Operating Layer unchanged.
- rev18 (v3.0.4 draft candidate): exact payload-parity + SHIP truth closure. Bumps the unified JSON install package to v3.0.4 and the Operating Layer installer projection / QA / README / changelog / SHIP pointers to the synchronized v3.0.4 candidate set; restores exact markdown↔JSON parity for all six Operating payload mirrors by matching the markdown payload-block boundary text exactly; fixes the stale 3.0.2 supersession line in SHIP; leaves runtime semantics, live commands, two-layer runtime shape, and 6-memory Operating Layer unchanged.
- rev17 (v3.0.3 draft candidate): integrity metadata + final truth closure. Bumps the unified JSON install package to v3.0.3 to correct stale System-layer payload-integrity metadata, bumps the Operating Layer installer projection / QA / README / SHIP / changelog pointers to the synchronized v3.0.3 candidate set, fixes the stale shipped-files version label in SHIP, corrects the duplicated/mislabeled revision-note entry, and fixes the remaining stale 3.0.1 label in the QA command-family regression lock; leaves runtime semantics, live commands, two-layer runtime shape, and 6-memory Operating Layer unchanged.
- rev15 (v3.0.1 draft candidate): narrow closure patch. Bumps the unified JSON install package to v3.0.1 and the Operating Layer installer projection to v3.0.1 to restore exact embedded installation-script parity; bumps QA to v3.0.1 so the old-token regression scan targets only active runtime/install/procedure surfaces and does not false-fail on explicitly historical mentions; bumps README to v3.0.1 and SHIP to rev15; leaves runtime semantics and live commands unchanged.
- rev14 (v3.0.0 draft candidate): major mini-line rebase. Adds unified JSON install package as primary install artifact and installation SSOT; normalizes commands to `SETUP / INSTALL / EXTRACT / REMEMBER / NEXT / FINAL_VERIFY`; changes build token from `HK_UNLOCK` to `APPROVE`; keeps the 2-layer runtime and compact 6-memory Operating Layer; documents Projects as optional booster mode only.
- rev13 (v2.3.7): Build gate token became `HK_UNLOCK`; updated System Layer installer (v2.3.3), Operating Layer installer (v2.3.4; Builder memory update), QA Pack (v2.3.7), and README (v2.3.7).
