# Helikon-mini Changelog

Canonical change record for the Helikon-mini bundle.
- Kit releases are tracked by **SHIP rev** + `vX.Y.Z` (see the current SHIP manifest).
- Component filenames may carry their own versions; the SHIP manifest is the SSOT for what ships.

## v3.0.9 — rev23 draft candidate (2026-04-06)
- SETUP-to-INSTALL handoff hard-binding + synchronized-surface closure on top of the 3.0.8 memory-settings hard-binding candidate.
- Bumped `Helikon-mini_Install_Package_v3.0.9.json` so the System Layer install authority now hard-binds the actual `SETUP` response to tell the operator, after both Personalization saves are confirmed, to return to the chat and send `INSTALL` to begin the 6-memory Operating Layer install loop while preserving the beginner-facing Personalization walkthrough, Memory-settings step, two-box mapping, and ordered save/reopen flow.
- Bumped `Helikon-mini_SYSTEM_LAYER_v3.0.4_install.md` to mirror the same hard-bound `SETUP` command surface in the synchronized human-readable projection/fallback.
- Bumped `Helikon-mini_OPERATING_LAYER_v3.0.9_install.md` to keep the package-pointer text synchronized with the new JSON package line while leaving payload text and runtime semantics unchanged.
- Bumped `Helikon-mini_QA_PACK_v3.0.9.md` to fail if the actual emitted `SETUP` response omits the required post-save handoff back to chat with `INSTALL`.
- Bumped `Helikon-mini_README_v3.0.9.md` and `Helikon-mini_SHIP_rev23.md` to the synchronized closure candidate set.
- Left live commands, System Layer snippet payload text, 2-layer runtime shape, and 6-memory Operating Layer unchanged.

## v3.0.8 — rev22 draft candidate (2026-04-02)
- Memory-settings hard-binding + synchronized-surface closure on top of the 3.0.7 SETUP-output hard-binding candidate.
- Bumped `Helikon-mini_Install_Package_v3.0.8.json` so the System Layer install authority now hard-binds the actual `SETUP` response to tell the operator, before pasting the snippets, to turn **Reference saved memories** ON, treat **Reference chat history** as optional best-effort only if present, and use a normal non-Temporary chat for installation while preserving the beginner-facing Personalization walkthrough, two-box mapping, and ordered save/reopen steps.
- Bumped `Helikon-mini_SYSTEM_LAYER_v3.0.3_install.md` to mirror the same hard-bound `SETUP` command surface in the synchronized human-readable projection/fallback.
- Bumped `Helikon-mini_OPERATING_LAYER_v3.0.8_install.md` to keep the package-pointer text synchronized with the new JSON package line and restore exact markdown↔JSON payload-boundary parity for the six Operating payload mirrors while leaving runtime semantics unchanged.
- Bumped `Helikon-mini_QA_PACK_v3.0.8.md` to fail if the actual emitted `SETUP` response omits the required Memory-settings step before the snippet text.
- Bumped `Helikon-mini_README_v3.0.8.md` and `Helikon-mini_SHIP_rev22.md` to the synchronized closure candidate set.
- Left live commands, System Layer snippet payload text, 2-layer runtime shape, and 6-memory Operating Layer unchanged.

## v3.0.7 — rev21 draft candidate (2026-04-02)
- SETUP output hard-binding + synchronized-surface closure on top of the 3.0.6 SETUP-clarity candidate.
- Bumped `Helikon-mini_Install_Package_v3.0.7.json` so the System Layer install authority now hard-binds the actual `SETUP` response to begin with a beginner-facing Personalization walkthrough before the snippets: plain-language explanation of Personalization as ChatGPT’s settings/customization area, profile/avatar/name-menu routing, explicit two-box mapping, explicit “do not paste both snippets into the same field” warning, and ordered save/reopen steps.
- Bumped `Helikon-mini_SYSTEM_LAYER_v3.0.2_install.md` to mirror the same hard-bound `SETUP` command surface in the synchronized human-readable projection/fallback.
- Bumped `Helikon-mini_OPERATING_LAYER_v3.0.7_install.md` to keep the package-pointer text synchronized with the new JSON package line while leaving payload text and runtime semantics unchanged.
- Bumped `Helikon-mini_QA_PACK_v3.0.7.md` to fail if the actual emitted `SETUP` response omits the beginner-facing walkthrough before the snippet text.
- Bumped `Helikon-mini_README_v3.0.7.md` and `Helikon-mini_SHIP_rev21.md` to the synchronized closure candidate set.
- Left live commands, System Layer snippet payload text, 2-layer runtime shape, and 6-memory Operating Layer unchanged.

 — rev20 draft candidate (2026-04-02)
- SETUP clarity + synchronized-surface closure on top of the 3.0.5 command-order-truth candidate.
- Bumped `Helikon-mini_Install_Package_v3.0.6.json` so the System Layer install authority explicitly routes first-time users to **Personalization** and the two correct paste targets (**Custom instructions** and **About you → More about you**) while leaving the runtime snippet payloads unchanged.
- Bumped `Helikon-mini_SYSTEM_LAYER_v3.0.1_install.md` to teach the same two-box SETUP path in the human-readable projection/fallback.
- Bumped `Helikon-mini_OPERATING_LAYER_v3.0.6_install.md` to keep the package-pointer text synchronized with the new JSON package line while leaving payload text and runtime semantics unchanged.
- Bumped `Helikon-mini_QA_PACK_v3.0.6.md` to add an explicit SETUP-clarity lock for first-time users.
- Bumped `Helikon-mini_README_v3.0.6.md` and `Helikon-mini_SHIP_rev20.md` to the synchronized closure candidate set.
- Left live commands, System Layer snippet payload text, 2-layer runtime shape, and 6-memory Operating Layer unchanged.

- Exact payload-parity + SHIP truth closure on top of the 3.0.3 integrity-closure candidate.
- Bumped `Helikon-mini_Install_Package_v3.0.4.json` to refresh synchronized package metadata and source-file inventory for the v3.0.4 set while leaving runtime semantics unchanged.
- Bumped `Helikon-mini_OPERATING_LAYER_v3.0.4_install.md`, `Helikon-mini_QA_PACK_v3.0.4.md`, `Helikon-mini_README_v3.0.4.md`, and `Helikon-mini_SHIP_rev18.md` to the synchronized exact-parity closure candidate set.

## v3.0.3 — rev17 draft candidate (2026-04-01)
- Final integrity/truth closure on top of the 3.0.2 truth-polish candidate.
- Bumped `Helikon-mini_Install_Package_v3.0.3.json` to correct stale System-layer payload-integrity metadata and refresh the synchronized source-file inventory for the v3.0.3 set.
- Bumped `Helikon-mini_OPERATING_LAYER_v3.0.3_install.md`, `Helikon-mini_QA_PACK_v3.0.3.md`, `Helikon-mini_README_v3.0.3.md`, and `Helikon-mini_SHIP_rev17.md` to the synchronized integrity-closure candidate set.
- Fixed the stale shipped-files version label and duplicated/mislabeled revision-note entry in SHIP, and fixed the remaining stale 3.0.1 label in the QA command-family regression lock.

- Corrected the stale 3.0.0 supersession wording in SHIP and fixed the v3.0.0 changelog entry so it names `Helikon-mini_Install_Package_v3.0.0.json` rather than the later 3.0.1 file.
- Left runtime semantics, live commands, 2-layer runtime shape, and 6-memory Operating Layer unchanged.

## v3.0.1 — rev15 draft candidate (2026-04-01)
- Narrow closure patch on top of the 3.0.0 draft candidate.
- Bumped `Helikon-mini_Install_Package_v3.0.1.json` and `Helikon-mini_OPERATING_LAYER_v3.0.1_install.md` to restore exact embedded Operating installation-script parity between the JSON package and markdown projection.

## v3.0.0 — rev14 draft candidate (2026-04-01)
- Major starter-line rebase from the 2.3.7 baseline.
- Added `Helikon-mini_Install_Package_v3.0.0.json` as the **primary install artifact** and **installation SSOT**.
- Re-labeled the System and Operating `_install` files as synchronized human-readable projections / fallbacks.
- Normalized the installer command family to:
  - `SETUP`
  - `INSTALL`
  - `EXTRACT`
  - `REMEMBER`
  - `NEXT`
  - `FINAL_VERIFY`
- Retired:
  - `HMS`
  - `HMO`
- Changed the build gate token from `HK_UNLOCK` to `APPROVE`.
- Preserved the 2-layer runtime:
  - System Layer = Personalization
  - Operating Layer = 6 Helikon-mini Saved Memories
- Preserved the compact 6-memory topology rather than expanding to a 12-pillar operating layer.
- Added explicit optional Projects booster posture while keeping projects outside the normative runtime contract.
- Bumped README, QA, SHIP, and installer surfaces to the 3.0.0 candidate set.

## v2.3.7 — rev13 (2026-02-17)

- System Layer install surface bumped to v2.3.3 (kernel sentinel update).
- Operating Layer install surface bumped to v2.3.4 (Meleteon.Builder memory update).
- QA Pack + README bumped to v2.3.7 to match shipped pointers.

## v2.3.6 — rev12 (2026-02-17)
- Operating Layer install surface bumped to v2.3.3; Aoideon.Canon memory content bumped to v2.3.2.
- Aoideon.Canon now anchors `EXPECTED_OPERATING_MEMORIES (6)` and a deterministic FULL/PARTIAL/NONE + missing-names rule to prevent hallucinated missing-name lists under PARTIAL installs.
- QA + README prompts updated to reference the anchored expected set and allow `missing: unknown` when the expected set is unavailable.

## v2.3.5 — rev11 (2026-02-17)
- Mechanical lineage renumber from the prior `0.3.x` kit series to `2.3.x` to avoid collision with archived Helikon-mini 1.x artifacts.
- Renamed shipped artifacts to `v2.3.x` and updated pointers/sentinels accordingly. No behavioral/protocol changes intended.
- Helikon-mini major versions are independent of Helikon (core) major versions.
